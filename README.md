# cec-monitor
HDMI-CEC library with a simple monitor written on ES6 to make cec enabled apps.

# Cache autorefresh is DISABLED in this fork to avoid deasync dependency

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @senzil/cec-monitor
```

## Examples

### Events

```javascript
import {CEC, CECMonitor} from 'cec-monitor';

//All config options are optionals
//the values are the deafults
let monitor = new CECMonitor('custom-osdname', {
  com_port: '',            //set com port to use (see cec-client -l)
  debug: false,           // enable/disabled debug events from cec-client
  hdmiport: 1,            // set inital hdmi port
  processManaged: false,  // set/unset handlers to avoid unclear process exit.
  recorder: true,         //enable cec-client as recorder device
  player: false,          //enable cec-client as player device
  tuner: false,           //enable cec-client as tuner device
  audio: false,           //enable cec-client as audio system device
  autorestart: true,      //enable autrestart cec-client to avoid some wierd conditions
  no_serial: {            //controls if the monitor restart cec-client when that stop after the usb was unplugged
    reconnect: false,       //enable reconnection attempts when usb is unplugged
    wait_time: 30,          //in seconds - time to do the attempt
    trigger_stop: false     //false to avoid trigger stop event
  },
  cache: {
    enable: false,  //treats the state like a cache, and enable _EXPIREDCACHE event.
    autorefresh: false, //enable the cache refresh (currently only power status), and enable _UPDATEDCACHE event.
    timeout: 30  //value greater than 0 (in seconds) enable cache invalidation timeout and request new values if autorefresh is enabled
  },         
  command_timeout: 3,       //An value greater than 0 (in secconds) meaning the timeout time for SendCommand function
  user_control_hold_interval: 1000 //An value greater than 0 (in miliseconds) meaning the interval for emit the special _USERCONTROLHOLD event
});


monitor.once(CECMonitor.EVENTS._READY, function() {
  console.log( ' -- READY -- ' );
  // Low-level
  monitor.WriteMessage(CEC.LogicalAddress.BROADCAST, CEC.LogicalAddress.TV, CEC.Opcode.GIVE_DEVICE_POWER_STATUS);
  // High-level
  monitor.SendMessage(null,null,CEC.Opcode.SET_OSD_NAME,'Plex'); // Broadcast my OSD Name
  monitor.SendMessage(null, CEC.LogicalAddress.TV, CEC.Opcode.GIVE_OSD_NAME); // Ask TV for OSD Name
});

monitor.on(CECMonitor.EVENTS.REPORT_POWER_STATUS, function (packet) {
  console.log('POWER STATUS CODE:',packet.data.val);
  console.log('POWER STATUS:',packet.data.str);
});

monitor.on(CECMonitor.EVENTS.ROUTING_CHANGE, function(packet) {
  console.log( 'Routing changed from ' + packet.data.from.str + ' to ' + packet.data.to.str + '.' );
});

monitor.on(CECMonitor.EVENTS.SET_OSD_NAME, function(packet) {
  console.log( 'Logical address ' + packet.source + 'has OSD name ' + packet.data.str);
});

// Any packet with an opcode (excludes debug, notify and other message types from cec-client
monitor.on(CECMonitor.EVENTS._OPCODE, function(packet) {
  console.log(packet);
});
```

Opcode-based events emitted provide a single parameter `packet` to the callback. The value is an object of the form:

```json
{
  "type": "TRAFFIC", "number": "82784", "flow": "IN", 
  "source": 1, "target": 4, "opcode": 144, "args": [0],
  "event": "REPORT_POWER_STATUS", 
  "data": {"val": 0, "str": "ON"}
}
```

Packets containing the following opcodes that are received are parsed, with the results added to a
`data` property.

* CEC.Opcode.ACTIVE_SOURCE
* CEC.Opcode.CEC_VERSION
* CEC.Opcode.DECK_STATUS
* CEC.Opcode.DEVICE_VENDOR_ID
* CEC.Opcode.REPORT_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS
* CEC.Opcode.REPORT_POWER_STATUS
* CEC.Opcode.ROUTING_CHANGE
* CEC.Opcode.SET_OSD_NAME
* CEC.Opcode.USER_CONTROL_PRESSED
* CEC.Opcode.USER_CONTROL_RELEASE

The `data` property contains the raw value, and a string representation of the parsed results stored
in the `arg` property, based on the `event` type / `opcode` value.  Where multiple values are parsed
from `args`, a substructure is created in the `data` property, as shown below for `ROUTING_CHANGE`.

```json
{
  "type": "TRAFFIC", "number": "23553258", "flow": "IN",
  "source": 0, "target": "1 5", "opcode": 128, "args": [0, 0, 16, 0],
  "event": "ROUTING_CHANGE",
  "data": {
    "from": {"val": 0, "str": "0.0.0.0"},
    "to": {"val": 4096, "str": "1.0.0.0"}
  }
}
```

### Sending CEC Messages

There are four APIs to choose from to send a message on the bus.  This section discusses each of these
methods, with examples.  

The message used in the examples broadcasts a SET_OSD_NAME message on the bus, setting playbackdevice1 
(logical address 04) on screen name to 'Frisbee'.

#### WriteRawMessage

`WriteRawMessage(raw)`

`WriteRawMessage` writes the low-level commands to `cec-client`.  Use this method as you type commands
directly to `cec-client` itself at the command line.  

```javascript
monitor.WriteRawMessage('tx 0F:46:46:72:69:73:62:65:65');
```

#### WriteMessage

`WriteMessage(source, target, opcode, args)`

`WriteMessage` is used to write `tx` messages to `cec-client`.  These are messages containing a low-level
protocol `opcode`.  Unlike `WriteRawMessage` which takes a string, and is sent unchanged, `WriteMessage` 
has a parameter list, and constructs a raw command from these parameters to send to `cec-client`.  

```javascript
monitor.WriteMessage(CEC.LogicalAddress.PLAYBACKDEVICE1, CEC.LogicalAddress.BROADCAST, CEC.Opcode.SET_OSD_NAME,[0x46,0x72,0x69,0x73,0x62,0x65,0x65]);
```

#### SendMessage

`SendMessage(source, target, opcode, args)`

`SendMessage` is a high-level API of the same form as WriteMessage, but accepts a range of different data
types and formats as input.  This is useful when sending messages from user input.  The following examples
illustrate how to use SendMessage

```javascript
monitor.SendMessage(CEC.LogicalAddress.PLAYBACKDEVICE1, CEC.LogicalAddress.BROADCAST, CEC.Opcode.SET_OSD_NAME,[0x46,0x72,0x69,0x73,0x62,0x65,0x65]);

monitor.SendMessage(4, 15, 70, [70,114,105,115,98,101,101]);

monitor.SendMessage('0x4', '0xF', '0x46', [0x46,0x72,0x69,0x73,0x62,0x65,0x65]);

monitor.SendMessage('PLAYBACKDEVICE1','BROADCAST','SET_OSD_NAME','Frisbee');

monitor.SendMessage('playbackdevice1', 'broadcast', 'set_osd_name','Frisbee');

// Can specify physical address as string, using dot notation
monitor.SendMessage(CEC.LogicalAddress.UNREGISTERED, CEC.LogicalAddress.BROADCAST, CEC.Opcode.ACTIVE_SOURCE,'2.0.0.0');

// Or as an array of bytes
monitor.SendMessage(CEC.LogicalAddress.UNREGISTERED, CEC.LogicalAddress.BROADCAST, CEC.Opcode.ACTIVE_SOURCE,[0x20,0x0]);

// Default source is the client - default destination is broadcast
monitor.SendMessage(null,null, 'set_osd_name','Frisbee');
```

#### SendCommand

`SendCommand(source, target, opcode, event, args)`

`SendCommand` is a high-level API of the same form as SendMessage, but adds an event parameter to wait for for a message as response.
This is useful when sending messages from user input and expects a response from the device.  The following examples
illustrate how to use SendCommand

```javascript
monitor.SendCommand(CEC.LogicalAddress.PLAYBACKDEVICE1, CEC.LogicalAddress.TV, CEC.Opcode.GIVE_DEVICE_POWER_STATUS, CECMonitor.EVENTS.REPORT_POWER_STATUS)
.then(packet => {
  console.log(packet)
//{
//  "type": "TRAFFIC", "number": "82784", "flow": "IN", 
//  "source": 1, "target": 4, "opcode": 144, "args": [0],
//  "event": "REPORT_POWER_STATUS", 
//  "data": {"val": 0, "str": "ON"}
//}
})
.catch(e => {
  console.error(e);
//Error: CEC monitor hasn't gotten response in some time (3000 ms) from 0
});
```

### cli.js

You can experiment with how cec-monitor works and the codes generated with your HDMI connected equipment by 
experimenting with the `bin/cli.js` script. This script implements a simple readline command interface where you can 
execute instructions and see how cec-monitor responds, allowing you to adapt to your requirements. Press `TAB` for
autocompletion of commands to see what it does and how to use it.

## Roadmap

* ~~Improve constructor to improve cec-client configuration~~
* ~~Implement more events with more context info~~
* ~~Implement RPI support~~
* Implement more and more events with more context info
* ~~Implement some user control actions as special events (combining USER_CONTROL_PRESSED and USERCONTROL RELEASE events)~~
* **Implement a ceclib adapter to avoid use a cec-client wrapper**
* Implement HDMI 2.0
